            <div class="content">
                <p>After being tasked with making a project about the future, my mind immediately went to the ideas of how our dreams from the future are shaped by our past. My target audience is people ages 18 and up. Since my project uses the notalgia of people’s past as a narrative, I need people who are old enough to remember their younger years as something different from who they are today. 
                </p>
                <p>The goal of this project is to get people thinking about how their dreams are influenced by the people around them. While our dreams are our own, what we are told to dream about by society and those close to us greatly influences what we end up deciding on.

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>While doing UX research, I came across a couple of narrative driven websites that I found very compelling. After analyzing them, I realized the reason they were so compelling was their combination of visuals and movement. Having both of those aspects made the websites feel more personal and made it easier to connect to the narrative as someone who is viewing it for the first time. For this reason, I decided to make sure my project had both visuals and animation. </p>

                <p>The second important thing I found while doing research was that making interactive forms has a lot to do with how they are presented. When the form is just a page full of questions it isn’t engaging enough to excite the viewer. However, if the questions are intertwined with the rest of the content, the whole journey feels more immersive. This is why I chose to combine the visuals, animation, and questions together.

                <img src="timeline1.jpg" alt="version 2 design">
                <p>For visual design I initially went with a more cartoon style. However, after getting halfway through the styling of the page, I was unhappy with how it was turning out and decided to switch to a more nostalgic look. I made the background a warm dark grey color and the text on the page a warm cream. I then included old photos of my childhood that I turned greyscale. This design gives a more polished look to it while still invoking feelings of nostalgia. </p>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>One design pattern I included was feedback. The first button has an alert that indicates it has been pressed and for users to continue on. Additionally, all of the buttons have a different style for their active state to show they have been pressed. </p>

                    <p>Another design pattern I included is progressive disclosure. I spaced out my questions so only one is visible at a time to reduce the mental load on the users.</p>

    <section id="revisions">

            <h2>Revisions</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>One of the main revisions I made after user-testing was with the buttons on the page. Since the buttons set back to their original style after being pressed users didn’t know if their clicks had gone through. For this reason, I added both an alert on the first button click as well as changed the active state of the buttons to be different and indicate to the user that their choice has been recorded. </p>

                <p>To further develop the project, I would add something to indicate that users are supposed to scroll on the first page. Some of the users were confused how to access the rest of the page because there is no indication of what action you should do to get the rest of it to populate.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Working on this project has  been very fulfilling for me. I learned a lot about how important it is to use design patterns so users know how to interact with the page. Additionally, I learned a lot about back4app and gsap by working with them on this project. I am most proud of the final design I landed on. I think it looks polished while still connecting to users.  </p>
                <p>The most challenging part of this project was the coding. I had a difficult time connecting the page to back4app and making the code work to report the people who had clicked. However, that also made finishing the coding section the most rewarding. Once it was done, I had a lot more confidence moving forward with the project.</p>
